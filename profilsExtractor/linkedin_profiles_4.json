With over 11 years of experience, including 9 years as a senior software engineer and 2 years as a system and network administrator, I am a valuable team player with a deep interest of programming, databases, network programming, operating systems and distributed systems.\n\nI spent 5 years in the payment industry, I've developed a keen interest and expertise in this field. My knowledge extends to payment industry standards, protocols, and technologies such as NDC+, D912 Protocol, ISO 8583, HSM, and EMV. My technical understanding of online payment processing flows, including merchants, acquirer banks, and issuer banks, further contributes to my proficiency in this area.\n\nPassionate about Generative AI, Cloud, Infrastructure, data structures, problem-solving, and system design, I demonstrate a commitment to continuous learning and embrace non-routine environments. I possess excellent coding skills in Java, C, and C++, and have experience in software development using UML and OOP paradigms. I am well-versed in design patterns, code optimization, and software architectures, enabling me to create efficient and robust solutions.\n\nWith a deep grasp of computer network fundamentals and experience in network troubleshooting using tools like TCPDump and Wireshark, I exhibit expertise in TCP, UDP, routing, switching, network programming, SSL/TLS, DNS, HTTP, FTP, and more. My proficiency extends to Linux systems administration, shell programming, and Oracle DB administration.\n\nI hold a strong knowledge of databases, including relational, object, relational-object, and NoSQL databases. I am skilled in Oracle APEX, SQL, T-SQL, PLSQL, relational data modeling, and database schema design. Additionally, I have also experience working with XML (DOM, SAX, DTD, XSD, XSLT, XPath) and JSON.\n\nMy academic background includes an Engineer's degree ENSMR (Ex. ENIM), a Master's degree from UCA/FSSM, and a Bachelor's degree from UH2/FSAC. I am a C/C++ and Java geek, showcasing my enthusiasm for programming languages.\n\nAlways open for new exciting opportunities, so to connect with me, you can reach out to me via LinkedIn or email at rachid.kabbab@gmail.com.\n\nOpen to Relocation | Visa Sponsorship Required.\n\nCheck out my Linked In profile for seeing some of my side projects : https://github.com/karachid",
